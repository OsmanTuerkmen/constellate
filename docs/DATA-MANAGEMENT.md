# Data management

How Constellate data moves from public sources into the app, what is versioned, which quality gates hold, and who owns what. Data contract: [app/README.md](../app/README.md). Sources and licences: [DATA-SOURCES.md](DATA-SOURCES.md), [data/MANIFEST.md](../data/MANIFEST.md).

## Flow

```
public sources (HPO, MONDO, Orphanet, CT.gov, Europe PMC, NIH RePORTER, Open Targets, Reactome, ClinVar, EMA, openFDA, NBS pages, Monarch)
  -> 01 fetch            data/raw/            bulk files, sha256 in data/MANIFEST.md
  -> 02 slice, 03 build  data/slice.json, data/graph_base.json
  -> 04 enrich           data/cache/<api>/ (one JSON per request) -> data/enrich/*.jsonl, edges_draft.json
  -> 04b enrich-extra    data/cache/extra/ -> data/enrich/extra_*  + data/curated/assets.csv
  -> 05 extract, 06 reconcile (OpenAI; reconcile reads data/curated/orgs.csv)
  -> 07 analytics        app/public/data/  (meta, index, core, disease/gene/phenotype shards)
  -> 08 trials           app/public/data/trial/
  -> app explain         app/public/data/explain/  (precomputed, optional)
  -> validate.py         gate: contract, ids, evidence, budgets, hero path
  -> app (Next.js on Vercel) reads /data/* as static files
```

## What is committed

| Path | Committed | Rebuilt by |
|---|---|---|
| `data/raw/`, `data/cache/`, `data/enrich/`, `data/slice.json`, `data/graph_base.json` | no (gitignored) | `make fetch` … `make enrich-extra` |
| `data/MANIFEST.md` | yes | `01_fetch` (data-v2 section by hand from `extra_run_log.jsonl`) |
| `data/curated/*.csv`, `*.yaml` | yes, hand-curated (orgs, hero path; assets: 04b) | people, plus 04b for `assets.csv` |
| `app/public/data/` | yes, the published dataset | `make analytics trials`, `npm run explain` |

The intermediate data lives only on the machine that ran the pipeline (today a single local machine). Cloud sessions reach GitHub and npm but no data hosts, so they can change code but cannot re-export.

## Versioning

- `meta.json` → `built_at` (UTC time of the 07 run) and `version` (`<date>+<git sha of 07_analytics.py>`). Together they identify a dataset; the commit that adds `app/public/data/` pins it in git.
- Edge ids are stable (`e_` + sha1(`source|target|type`)[:12]), so links and precomputed explanations survive a re-export with the same edges.
- Each evidence record carries `retrieved` (fetch date) and `date` (source date); each source carries its release or retrieval date in `meta.sources`.
- Cache: `/data/*` is served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=3600` (`app/next.config.ts`). File names are not versioned, so `immutable` is deliberately not used.

## Size budgets (`pipeline/validate.py`)

| Item | Budget | Today (built 2026-10-03 19:57 UTC) |
|---|---|---|
| `core.json` + `index.json` | < 3 MB | 2.92 MB |
| each disease / gene / phenotype / trial shard | < 150 KB | largest 140 KB (MONDO_0001982), MLD 133 KB |
| phenotype shard | ≤ 100 diseases listed | ok |
| data-v2 fields per disease shard (proposed) | ≤ 12 KB | not exported yet |

New node kinds (asset, drug, country, person) never go into `index.json` or `core.json`.

## Re-export procedure

1. On the data machine: `git pull --rebase`, `make enrich enrich-extra` (or `--offline` to reuse the cache).
2. `make analytics trials validate`. Validate must print `OK`. Read the size line and the hero line.
3. Spot-check per script: hero shards (Krabbe MONDO:0009499, MLD MONDO:0018868, PMD MONDO:0010714), counts against the previous export, no e-mail or phone pattern under `app/public/data/`.
4. `cd app && npm run explain -- --dry-run`, then regenerate explanations if the action-card edge sets changed. Validate again.
5. `cd app && npm ci && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm run e2e`.
6. Commit only `app/public/data/` (prefix `data:`, one sentence), `git pull --rebase`, push, open or update the PR. Vercel deploys on merge.

## Quality gates before the freeze

- `make validate` green; hero path all `ok`.
- Every number in the product comes from a primary source (PMID, NCT, ORPHA, EMA, FDA, official page); gaps show as `UNBELEGT` or Honest Gap.
- Evidence levels are never raised: `has_asset`, `approved_therapy` and `screened_in` are `curated` only with a structured record or a verbatim official quote; regex finds in abstracts are `text_mined`; `kol_overlap` and similarity are `inferred` with a `formula`.
- `contradicting` is present on every edge.
- No personal contact data (e-mail, phone) for researchers or study staff; names, ORCID, institution and record ids only.
- Only verified rows of `orgs.csv` and `hero_path.yaml` reach the product.
- e2e green at 1280 px and 375 px.

## Ownership

| Area | Owner |
|---|---|
| `data/curated/assets.csv`, `data/enrich/extra_*` | Data Chief / Data Manager session (local) |

## Checklist: freeze the dataset (Sunday 11:00, before the repo goes public)

- [ ] Last re-export merged; `meta.json` `built_at` and `version` noted in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- [ ] `make validate` green on `main`; size line and hero line copied into STATUS.
- [ ] `npm run e2e` green on `main`; the live site shows the same `built_at` on `/methods`.
- [ ] `meta.metrics` present or explicitly "pending" (no invented numbers).
- [ ] `meta.sources` lists every source shown in the product, with licence.
- [ ] Grep of `app/public/data/`, `data/curated/` and `docs/` for e-mail, phone, keys, local paths, server internals: 0 hits.
- [ ] `orgs.csv` and `hero_path.yaml` contain only verified rows (`verified_date` set).
- [ ] No open data branch is merged after 12:00 except P1 fixes; nothing is pushed after 14:45.
- [ ] Tag the commit (`git tag data-freeze-2026-10-04 && git push origin data-freeze-2026-10-04`) so the submitted dataset is reproducible.
